			<h3>we create a system in which we identify athletically gifted invididuals and clone them on a mass scale (perhaps 15 or 20 individual clones). Once there are 20 or 30 groups of clones, and the clones have reached adolescence, you provide them with world-class training in sports. Maybe this training is given to them by an AI or computer or some moderated knowledge dispersal system so that they gain roughly the same training. After years of training and scrimming against other clone-teams, they enter the clone-league of sports. Because the same genotype is playing each role in the sport, winners of series can be rightly said to be the best player of that sport.</h3>
